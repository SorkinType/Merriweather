<p> Merriweather is serifed typeface family designed for the needs of contemporary screen reading.</p>

<p>Merriweather was initially released in 2010 by Eben Sorkin under the SIL Open Font License. The current 2020 release has 120 styles and is offered in both variable font and static font formats. Axis of variation in the design include optical, width and weight.</p>

<p>Optical sizes start with the orignal design which is for small sizes or 7pt; Text is for the most used size ranges 10-24pt; Head is for headlines and subheads sizes 25-71pt; Display is for 72-108pt use; and Big is for 109-144pts or larger. Widths range from Semi-Condensed; Regular width and Semi-Expanded. The spacing and weight of these widths have been adjusted to maintain consistent paragraph color. This allows a mobile layout to look consistent with one for desktop even as the mobile layout takes advantage of the space savings of a narrower width. Weights are not changed. they are Light, Regular, Bold and Black.</p>

<p>Merriweather's family style grafts Italian Renaissance style onto sturdy Dutch proportions resulting in a feeling that is warm, familiar, trustable and contemporary.</p>

<p>Merriweather supports Latin and Cyrillic scripts and has robust language support in both scripts. It also provides a full range of number styles and small caps.</p>
