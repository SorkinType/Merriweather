# Merriweather FONTLOG

This file provides detailed information on Merriweather font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Merriweather fonts and any derivative works.

## Basic Font Information

Merriweather offers a Renaissance warmth while using proportions which are space-saving.
It is suitable for editorial design, news and other kinds of space sensitive typography.
Merriweather is an evolving project and will be updated.

Merriweather is actively developed and is improved upon periodically.

Merriweather is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts e.g. Greek, Devanagari, Ethiopic, Arabic and so on.

## Contributing

There are 2 source files, one for Romans and one of Italics, in the [GlyphsApp](https://www.glyphsapp.com) format.

To contribute to the project, file issues at <https://github.com/EbenSorkin/Merriweather> or contact Eben Sorkin directly at <sorkineben@gmail.com>

## Build Process

The sources can be built with FontMake and Statmake. These are run with .sh and .py scripts. Additions to these scripts may be made.

### Step 1: Set up the project locally

The build process requires you to open up a terminal and navigate to this project's directory. Open a terminal, then navigate to the a directory (folder) for type projects, and git clone this repo.

```bash
cd path/to/type_repos_directory

# then
git clone https://github.com/SorkinType/Merriweather.git
```

You should use a Python virtual environment to build this project. If you've never set up a virtual environment before, [read more about it in this guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments).

You can set up a Python 3 virtual environment with:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

Here, `python3 -m venv` calls the virtual-environment-making module, then the `./venv` gives it a path to setup a virtual environment in (you could give a different path, but this is a conventional name).

Before you install dependencies or run the build, you need to activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

If you wish exit out of the virtual environment, you can use the command `deactivate` (just remember to start it up again if you come back). You can also simply close the terminal session.

Once you've activated the venv, install requirements by pointing pip to the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Setting up for woff & woff2 conversion**

The build script also converts outputs to web-ready formats, `woff` & `woff2`.

To enable this, use Homebrew ([install it from here](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already) to get tools from [bramstein/homebrew-webfonttools](https://github.com/bramstein/homebrew-webfonttools):

```
brew install woff2
brew install sfnt2woff-zopfli
```

**Installing TTFautohint (for static builds only)**

Download the latest version of TTFautohint from https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/, unzip the file (e.g. `ttfautohint-1.8.3-tty-osx.tar.gz`), and place the unix executable file directly into the new `venv/bin` within this project.

### Step 2: Give permissions to build scripts

The first time you run the build, you will need to give run permissions to the build scripts.

On the command line, navigate to the project folder (`cd Merriweather`), and then give permissions to the shell scripts with:

```bash
chmod +x sources/*.sh
```

Using `chmod +x` gives shell scripts execute permissions. In general, before you do this for shell scripts, you should probably take a look through their contents, to be sure they aren't doing anything you don't want them to do. The ones in this repo simply build from the GlyphsApp sources and apply various fixes to the results.

### Step 3: Run the build scripts!

Now, run the build script by entering its relative path in your terminal:

```bash
sources/build.sh
```
The Script build.sh calls subscripts which can also be run individually if needed. For example build-var.sh and build-statics.sh

If you've set up your dependencies correctly, it should build and place fonts into the `/fonts` sub-directory of the project.

## ChangeLog

* Variable Font now has Optical Size (opsz); Widths (wdth) added to Weight (wght) axis.
* 24 Masters now (we had 4 before)
* Deeper redesign and re-spacing of Cyrillic for better texture and rhythm
* STAT table added for better Microsoft OS support
* Small caps numbers, new symbols and additional punctuation
* Small caps are added to new masters
* Kerning is added added to new masters and added to generally
* Further rationalizing of the kern groups
* Minor shape corrections for color and consistency
* New CASE OT support
* Improved Cyrillic localization support

### 5 April 2019 (Eben Sorkin) Merriweather v2.005
* changed UPM to 2000
* Small caps are added
* "Zero" 0 Value kern pair eliminated
* Kerning is added for both Latin and Cyrillic
* Some respacing (losening ) of the Cyrillic, especially the italic.
* Further rationalizing of the kern groups
* Minor shape corrections for color and consistency
* Added cursor Carat data diacritics in the italic
* Added family alignment zones to font level settings
* Added upper blue zone for small caps

### 2 Feb 2019 (Eben Sorkin) Merriweather v2.004

* Primary respacing of Latin in both Roman and Italic from n, and o and H and O outward. The color in text is much improved.
* Changed the space glyph width ( yes really! ) for better color and more consistency in apparent approach across weights
* Adding a significant amout of kerning to both Roman and Italic.
* Changes to some glyph shapes for increased eveness in color and design consistency. Glyphs include : J,K,M,N,R,T,V,W,X,Y,Ezh
* Changes to diacritics so that standard 'comb' and 'combcase' diacritics are used.
* Improved diacritic placement and design especially tilde, caron, acute, grave
* Addition of support for stacking diacritics to support new langauge support for example 'emacronacute' ( Unicode 1E17 )
* Addition of new diacritics including commaturnedmod, doubleprimemod, firsttonechinese, fourthtonechinese, primemod, ringhalfleft, ringhalfright, secondtonechinese, verticallinelowmod, verticallinemod, dblgravecomb, brevebelowcomb, macronbelowcomb, strokeshortcomb, strokelongcomb
* Changed the aproach to Aringacute to be consistent with the more permissive verical metrics. Thanks Vietnamese and other stacking glyphs!
* Added support for scandinavian symbols accountof, addressedtothesubject, ( Unicodes 2100 and 2101)
* Added Currency symbols hryvnia, kip, manat, tenge, tugrik
* Added Arrow symbols to Italic
* Added Greek letters ( Delta, Omega, mu ) and rationalized their names and unicodes vs Ohm, increment, product, summation
* Tabular Lining figures and Tabular Old Style figures added to Italic.
* Improved premade fractions with kerning of their components
* Improved verical placement of inferior and superior small numbers.
* 4 kinds of small numbers for fractions, superiors for foot notes and inferiors for scientific notation to Italic.
* Corrected design mistake in Cyrillic glyph "Komizje-cy" ( Unicode 0504 )
* Created initial version of small caps for Roman and Italic in the sources. However they don't currently export because they are a) not done and b) have no kerning. Small caps are made for Latin, Cyrillic, Greek Symbols and Figures. Small caps are using comb diacritics. Small cap punctuation and currency could be added - I am not sure if I think this make sense or not yet.       Notes:       - I also don't yet understand what the best design approach to small caps for digraphs including DZ, DZcaron, Dz, Dzcaron, NJ, Nj, is.       - The final remix RMX Scaller settings used to make the small caps were Width 96, Height 87 Weight 2 and 1 and adjust spacing 2.
* Improved number or figure design for both Roman and Italic
* Made many under the hood changes in Glyphs to make the files more effcient to work in in glyphs by linking sidebearings, widths and updating kern groups. This was especially touchy for cyrillic because many of the italic forms can't be linked in a parallel to their roman or upright opposites.
* Improved Ldot but I don't feel this solution is final.
* Cyrillic kerning is still not really complete.
* Support for Serbian added ( be-cy.loclSRB ) but not yet Serbian Italic.
* Full pinyin support still requires 8 more glyphs.
* Discovered that changing the name NULL to uni0000 permits Glyphs to export a Variable Font from sources
* Support for the following Google glyph sets is complete    - Core    - Plus Optional    - Plus Unique    - Pro Unique    - Pro Optional
* Support for Google glyph sets "expert_unique-glyphs" which contains small caps is next
